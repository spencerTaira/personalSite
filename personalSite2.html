    <h1>About Spencer</h1>
    <!-- <h1 id="name">Spencer</h1> -->
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Software Engineering job by way of Rithm School. I am making a career shift out of
        the consumer packaged goods business because, during Covid, I was able to reevaluate my life, goals, and interests. I had always had an affinity for
        all things computer related when I was younger, and I even dabbled a bit into Java and C++. When I evaluated my current
        life, I realized that I had somehow slowly slipped out of the path of technology and into a more business focused career.
        In order to pursue my true passion, I decided to quit my job and enroll at Rithm School.</p>
      <p>Prior to enrolling at Rithm, my affinity towards computers led me to get a BS in Electrical Engineering. Here I learned
        a great deal about hardware components and even hardware level programming with Assembly language and VHDL, but most
        importantly I learned how to learn and how to problem solve. After graduating, I pursued a few internships, but I felt
        like I was not able to use the creative problem solving skillset that I loved so much. Often times, the “sandbox” that
        I was allowed to work in was very restrictive and its focus and vision was very narrow.</p>
      <p>This led me to move out of Engineering into a rotational business role where I would be able to work with all parts of
        a business both horizontally and vertically. I worked on everything from supply chain and logistics to project
        management, finance, ,and business development. I had the opportunity to work with multiple departments, leadership,
        and outside customers and vendors. After learning about the entire business, I realized that I wanted additional
        education in the form of an MBA which I received at the UCLA Anderson School of Business. This helped round out a lot
        of the technical skills that I picked up during my time in Engineering with a lot of personal and management skills that
        helped me be a better worker, manager, and leader.</p>
      <p>Both Engineering and Business were important milestones in my life and added valuable experience and skills on which I
        am able to this day draw upon, but I finally realized that programming was the medium which would allow me the creativity
        to create and problem solve, not only, in my work life, but also, in my home life and projects.</p>
